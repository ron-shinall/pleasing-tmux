# pleasing-tmux
I wanted a simple, clean and effective tmux “theme” that didn’t require any plug-ins, was pleasing to look at, and conveyed pertinent information in an easy to comprehend layout. If you want the CPU & memory status you will need a plkugin for that, but it's purely optional. 

# Configuration
Copy the contents of `tmux/tmux.conf` to your setup And reload your tmux configuration (or detach & reattach). Note: if you decide to use the CPU & memory plug-in, the order of the plug-ins matters and it should be the last one to the list, but before run `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm`.
